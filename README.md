Businesses use data analytics to aid in making better business decisions, analyze customer trends and satisfaction. Ultimately, using data analytic tools and techniques enforce businesses to update and improve their products and services based on their customers’ feedback. 

For this project, the theme is Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis. Text mining is the process of transforming text into a more structured format (Elmasri & Navathe, 2016). The purpose of this transformation is to identify meaningful patterns, hidden relationships and new insights about the data being used. A common text mining technique is Natural Language Processing (NLP). Natural language processing is utilized by analyzing different syntaxes and semantics to understand the meaning and structure of the human language incorporated into the dataset (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). 
Additionally, sentimental analysis is one subtype of natural language processing. This type of analysis focuses on analyzing raw text to understand sentiment such as positive, negative and neutral (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). Businesses often use sentimental analysis to understand their customers' relationship with their brand (Elmasri & Navathe, 2016). Eventually, such analyses provide insight for businesses to improve their services and overall user experiences.
 
Thus, this project will address the following research questions: Is there a relationship between the users’ search contents and the results displayed? To what degree are the results shown? And, are there ways to identify and quantify the factors that impact the results shown?
 
The data being used for this project will be the Yelp dataset, found on their website (Yelp, 2022). The Yelp dataset is categorized by the following subsets: Business, Check In, Review, Tip, and User. For the purpose of this project, the focus will be on the Review data subset. 
 
The tools being used for this project are R Studio and Google Colab for the Python environment. Using the Google Colab Python environment, the NLTK package for Natural Language Processing and machine learning will be implemented to conduct the sentimental analysis. Visuals will be provided using matplotlib and ggplots.
